- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Frontend: React, CSS

## Architecture and Design
This follows the [Feature-Sliced Design(FSD) Architecture](https://feature-sliced.design/), which helps organize frontend code into clear and maintainable layers.

### Why FSD?
- Modularization: Divides the app into reusable and independent modules.
- Scalability: Supports project growth with a well-defined structure.
- Maintainability: Reduces complexity by separating concerns.

## Project Structure
- **Modules:**
  - `public/` : Public assets (favicons, images, etc.)
  - `src/` : Source code
    - `app/` :
      - `styles` : Global Styles
    - `pages/` : Page-level Components
    - `shared/` : Shared assets 
  - `index.html` : The main HTML file that serves the React app
  - `package.json` : Contains project dependencies, scripts, and metadata
  - `vite.config.js` : Configuration file for Vite






## Future Enhancements
